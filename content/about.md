# About Me

Hi, my name's Daniel. 

I'm a core contributor to [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) and a big fan of all things Apple. 

I enjoy running, watching anime and picking up new skills. I'm a lifelong learner at heart.

I've built exactly one LEGO set in my life. And I loved every second of it!

Lately, I've been getting into mechanical watches. 

You can find me on [X](https://x.com/mollyiv) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mollyIV).
