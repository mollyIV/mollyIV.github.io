Some time ago, [I proposed rewriting parts of fastlane in Swift](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/discussions/29570). It’s a bold direction, but I believe it’s necessary for the project’s long-term health. The proposal hasn’t gained much traction. I figured it might need a push, so I started building a minimum viable product.

As soon as the idea struck me, I opened Xcode, created a blank project, and watched the cursor blink. I was excited; deep down, I felt like it was the beginning of something big.

I started by working on a feature for building iOS projects, but after some research, I realized a few things. First, there were already solid solutions available. Second, it wasn’t an exciting feature. It didn’t seem like something that would spark interest or capture people's attention.

So, I pivoted.

What does fastlane do well that is still highly valuable? 

[Code signing](https://docs.fastlane.tools/codesigning/getting-started/).

It’s one of the most painful parts of iOS development, and fastlane remains a go-to solution. I started digging into it again and quickly realized how much work even a small proof of concept would require.

After a few days, I started questioning what I was doing.

I didn’t doubt that fastlane in Swift was a good idea; [I truly believe it is](https://mollyiv.dev/blog/2025-05-26/).

But I started questioning whether I wanted to lead such a substantial effort.

## My open source beginnings 

I’ve always loved the idea of open source. I began contributing early in my career, and it became one of the biggest accelerators for my growth as a developer. I met talented people, learned a lot, and improved quickly. 

I focused on projects I used and liked, which made a huge difference. 

You’re more likely to stay motivated when you work on something you genuinely enjoy. You already understand the domain, so you can identify what’s missing. Best of all, you can finally ship features you always wished existed in your favorite software. How cool is that?

One project that stuck with me was fastlane.

Initially, I fixed small bugs. Then, I began replying to GitHub issues. Later, I built new features. I showed up every day and put in the work.

Eventually, people took notice. I became a core contributor, and that was a huge milestone for me.

## Question the path, not just the code

These days, I need a clear **why** before I commit to a project. I’ve worked on things without a goal in mind, just going through the motions, and I burned out. I’ve learned my lesson.

### Why do I want to work on fastlane in Swift? 

**Preparing for what’s ahead**

The pace of change in tech is astonishing. AI is everywhere, and headlines claim it will take our jobs.

I prefer predictability; uncertainty makes me anxious.

So, I started to think: how do I stand out, not just from other developers but from AI?

Working on a meaningful open-source project could be one answer.

**Craftsmanship**

I believe in continuous learning. Leading this project would push me to grow in various areas, not just technical ones. It would help me get better at driving a product forward, prioritizing features, writing educational content, and bringing people together around a common goal.

Rewriting fastlane in Swift would level up my skills across the board.

**Community**

I hope this project would capture attention and bring great minds to the table. Working in a team makes everything easier. It keeps you motivated, helps you grow, and makes showing up every day feel worthwhile.

### What’s holding me back

**Risk** 

What if no one cares about fastlane in Swift?

What if I build this and no one joins me? Will I have the mental strength to finish it alone?

Working solo is challenging. Burnout is a real risk. I could invest months of energy into something that never takes off.

**Time**

I have been coding professionally for over a decade, and I already spend most of my day writing code.

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on the importance of being well-rounded. My generation was taught to specialize, but I’m not sure that’s the only path anymore.

Leonardo da Vinci was an artist, engineer, and scientist. 

Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter, and poet. 

Sure, those are extreme examples, but they remind me that it’s okay to be curious, to try new things, and to explore different parts of yourself.

**Not future-proof** 

Big tech used to value open-source work. But what if that’s changed? If open source no longer carries the same weight, then this project might not ease my anxiety about the future.

## Summary

The rapid pace of change in tech makes it tempting to act fast and reflect later. 

I’ve learned that moving forward without a clear purpose leads to burnout, not progress.

Open source shaped my journey, and I still care deeply about it. But how I engage with it is starting to change.
